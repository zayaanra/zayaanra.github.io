        <p>
          Hello, I'm Zayaan and I am a software engineer with experience in
          AI/GenAI/LLMs, full-stack web development, and systems programming. I have a passion for creating technology that solves real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University
          of Buffalo and am currently working towards my Master of Science in
          Computer Science at New York University.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in Buffalo, I was a teaching assistant for two systems
          programming courses and also a software engineering intern at
          Cytocybernetics, an organization that does research in
          electrophysiology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also most recently completed a software engineer internship at Telaverge Communications where I learned the intricacies of AI/LLMs and how it can be applied to real-world problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently looking for software engineering full-time roles. Please feel free to contact me using the information provided below.

            <h3>Cloud Based Coding Assistant</h3>
            <p>
              This was another interesting project. I wanted to combine my knowledge of LLMs and cloud computing together, so what better to do that than just creating a coding assistant that combines
              the best of both worlds? First, I worked a few other developers to create this project. We decided that we can create this coding assistant through VSCode (inspired by GitHub copilot and other extensions!).
              Next step was the most fun part - design a system architecture using various cloud computing compnents. We decided that using AWS would be the easiest. There were several components we included. API Gateway and Lambda
              were to be used as the RESTful API and handling the endpoints. SageMaker would be used to a host the Meta Code Llama 70B LLM (we actually tested several models but found that this one was the best for our use case).
              We also didn't want to complicate user setup so we simplified that by using AWS Cognito which handles user storage and authentication for us. At this point, I felt like something was missing. I wanted to implement a small
              dashboard that could visualize user metrics (like what languages they used and what type of requests they made to the LLM). For this, I decided to use SQS and DynamoDB. A SQS queue was used for temporary storage of user
              metrics until an EventBridge schedule would later pull those metrics out and perform one batch write to DynamoDB. Finally, the dashboard which was written in HTML was hosted in a S3 bucket.

            <h3>Containerized Task Management</h3>
            <p>
              This is a personal favorite of mine. This is a project that allows you keep track of tasks that you have to complete. However, the core of the project is not the main application itself.
              Instead, it is the containerization and deployment of the project that made it so interesting and fun. I took this project as a way to continue work with Docker and learn something new - Kubernetes.
              Kubernetes is an open-source system that allows for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Learning about K8s was fascinating because it has so many moving components.
              I utilized K8s to configure and expose a deployment as a service. I also wanted to combine this with a AWS service, so I set up a cluster on AWS EKS with several nodes for the containerized application.

            <h3>CampusConnect</h3>
            <p>
              CampusConnect is a web application that allows students to connect with clubs and organizations on within New York University.
              I worked with four other developers to create this application and was responsible for building RESTful APIs that serve data to the React front-end.
              I also worked on custom hooks and components with the Material UI framework. Finally, the project was hosted using an AWS EB and a PostgreSQL database was used on
              AWS RDS. This was a more in-depth experience with AWS and I learned a lot more about cloud computing.

              <p>
                As a way to familiarize myself with the Java Swing framework and
                AWS (RDS), I created a music player. This music player provides
                file upload and playlist functionality. MySQL is used as the
                database to store playlists, user information, as well as songs.
                The database was hosted on AWS (RDS) and was my first time
                interacting with AWS.

              <p>
                Raft is a distributed systems algorithm that aims to solve the consensus problem - making sure that multiple servers agree on the same values. My Raft implementation was coded in Go.
                The project helped me understand fault tolerance, log replication, leader election, and much more. This project is apart of the reason why I love distributed systems and hope to learn
                more about it.

                  Bullboard is an online bulletin board that allows users to post, read, and chat in real time to help search for housing and roommates for students that live at the University at Buffalo.
                  Collaborating with four other developers, I worked on the back-end which was written in Python. To store user data, MongoDB was used and I also provided support for that. Furthermore,
                  I implemented the real time chat communication through JavaScript web sockets.

                  This was a project while I was learning systems programming and it is one of the most important projects I feel I have ever done. It was implemented in C and replaced the standard C library
                  allocation functions <em>malloc, calloc, realloc,</em> and <em>free</em>. It helped me understand how memory management works and the differences between the stack and heap.
