        <!-- <img src="IMG_5681.jpg" alt="Zayaan Rahman" /> -->
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Zayaan and I am a software engineer with experience in
          full-stack web development and systems programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University
          of Buffalo and am currently working towards my Master of Science in
          Computer Science at New York University.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in Buffalo, I was a teaching assistant for two systems
          programming courses and also a software engineering intern at
          Cytocybernetics, an organization that does research in
          electrophysiology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have significant experience in full-stack web development and
          systems programming. I hope to learn more about cloud computing and
          distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently looking for software engineering internships and/or
          full-time roles. Please feel free to contact me using the information
          provided below.

                As a way to familiarize myself with the Java Swing framework and
                AWS (RDS), I created a music player. This music player provides
                file upload and playlist functionality. MySQL is used as the
                database to store playlists, user information, as well as songs.
                The database was hosted on AWS (RDS) and was my first time
                interacting with AWS.

                Raft is a distributed systems algorithm that aims to solve the consensus problem - making sure that multiple servers agree on the same values. My Raft implementation was coded in Go.
                The project helped me understand fault tolerance, log replication, leader election, and much more. This project is apart of the reason why I love distributed systems and hope to learn
                more about it.

                Bullboard is an online bulletin board that allows users to post, read, and chat in real time to help search for housing and roommates for students that live at the University at Buffalo.
                Collaborating with four other developers, I worked on the back-end which was written in Python. To store user data, MongoDB was used and I also provided support for that. Furthermore,
                I implemented the real time chat communication through JavaScript web

              <p>
                This was a project while I was learning systems programming and it is one of the most important projects I feel I have ever done. It was implemented in C and replaced the standard C library
                allocation functions <em>malloc, calloc, realloc,</em> and <em>free</em>. It helped me understand how memory management works and the differences between the stack and heap.
